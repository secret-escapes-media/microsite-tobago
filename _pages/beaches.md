      - Along the southeastern coast, you’ll find the beaches that have made Tobago a hit sea-and-sand destination for generations. Close to the buzzing towns of Crown Point, Scarborough and Black Rock, you can find your perfect beach paradise.
      - Pigeon Point is always the first recommendation by Tobagonians, rated as one of the 100 best beaches in the world. Long white sands and gorgeous blue water awaits, with the calling-card of the island, the thatched-roof jetty, forming a perfect backdrop for your island snaps.
      - "Bon Accord Lagoon, a mangrove-fringed pool teeming with wildlife, also has a fantastic beach, though only reachable by boat: the curiously named No Man’s Land. Buccoo Bay is perfect for snorkelling, with the Buccoo Reef teeming with colourful wildlife. In the middle of the reef, a shallow sandbank called the Nylon Pool is a unique spot for excellent snorkelling and swimming in clear waters; as a bonus, the peculiar pool is teeming with myths and legends..."

      - Go where the trade wind blows and kick-back on the most gorgeous beaches in the Caribbean. This is the more predictable coastline, where the weather is less changeable and the waters clear. The further east you head, the wilder the beaches get.
      - Head for Englishman’s Bay and discover a narrow strip of golden sand, with rich green forest bursting in at all corners. It’s quite a sight, best glimpsed from the lookout point at the head of the trail. A similar untamed beauty can be found at Pirate’s Bay, which rightfully is an adventure to get to. Follow a forested trail or arrive by boat and kick-back in an untouched idyll. If you can’t get enough of the rainforest treks, Celery Bay offers a similar paradise after a wild trail through thick, forested tracks.
      - If that kind of adventure isn’t for you, because after all, you’re here to relax, then don’t miss the more accessible Mt.Irvine Bay, Stone Haven Bay and Castara Bay. You’ll find the same irresistible Caribbean waters, only a few more choice amenities; that means sitting in a beach bar with a cool drink, gazing over a truly beautiful beach scene.

      - The Windward Coast is as off-the-beaten-path as it gets on Tobago. Following the Windward Road is the best way to explore the many untapped and hidden beaches and coves on the southern edge of the island. The Atlantic churns unpredictably, one of the reasons this side of the island is less explored – but the pay-off is clear. You’ll find beaches you can have all to yourself, and the diving can be pretty spectacular.
      - King’s Bay in the east is one of the more established beaches on the Windward Coast. Coconut trees line the powder-soft sands, where beach bums can recline for hours, doing very little at all. Go for a snorkel, gazing at the vibrant reefs just offshore. Though you’ll find all the necessary amenities here, you’ll most likely have most of the beach to yourself. At the right time of day, you can watch local fisherman pulling seine, a traditional way of fishing with a net. That also means the catch of the day could be yours; there’s a small hubbub once the nets are pulled in, as locals rush to buy the best fish.
      - The Windward Coast offers a chance for you to create your own adventure. Following the coastal road, you’ll get to the heart of rural Tobago, spying any opportunity for a quiet cove or beach strip that you can have all to yourself.
