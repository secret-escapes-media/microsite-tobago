      - You’re going to find irresistible Caribbean staples on Tobago; that lip-smacking heat from the scotch bonnet, the sweet tang of mango and pineapple, and the smoky flavours of grilled meats and fish. On the street, Doubles (a kind of curried-chickpea-fried-sandwich bite of heaven), roti, and chow (a bowl of chopped fruits spiced and seasoned to perfection) are the best on-the-go snacks. For the best local flavour, try that Tobago staple – curried crab and dumplings. Over at Store Bay, you’ll find a string of shacked vendors; everyone has their favourite, dishing up the island’s signature (and wonderfully messy) dish.
      - For proper dining, you’re spoilt for choice. Family-run eateries are found across the island, with menus that reflect the wealth of local produce on offer; think the freshest fish and locally-grown fruit and vegetables. Lobster is one of the island’s masterstrokes, so head to Tobago Paradise Travel & Grill (a nice, short, catchy title) for some of the best lobster in Tobago, topped by rustic beachfront dining. For more dining with a view, don’t miss the effortlessly romantic Makara, where Creole shrimp with cassava grits and blackened fish with coconut sauce are dished up on a balcony overlooking Buccoo Bay. For creative fusion feasts, Brown Cow puts creative twists on classic dishes, using only the best local ingredients.

      - Go lime with the locals. In this corner of the Caribbean, liming is a wonderful turn of phrase for hanging out, those small, impromptu gatherings after work, as the sun sets. And the centre of local life? That Caribbean stalwart, the much-loved and humble rum shack. These colourful bars are always buzzing with activity, and are the best place to meet the warm people of the island. Head for the nostalgia of Pumpy’s, or chill at the beach bar Bago. Ocean view is popular on a Friday, when the barbecue is rolled out and the souse is a-plenty. For unmatched beauty, Bacolet Beach Bar is the place to grab a cocktail, with treehouse seating and verandas overlooking a quiet cove.
      - The cross-island weekend hangout starts at 10pm in Buccoo. You’ll find the usual tourist fare before that time; the steel-pan band will be playing, with rum cocktails in flow. In the background however, the speaker boxes are being strung up, and locals begin to fill the area. The band stops playing and the rumble of the subwoofers starts. This is Sunday School. Dancehall, calypso, soca and more fill the air with an electricity that moves a now bumping dance floor to attention. This is the party to head for on Tobago – don’t miss it.

      - Discover what shaped modern Tobago at a number of historic and cultural sights. Along the coastline, you’ll find the imposing defensive forts of Tobago’s former colonisers. Fort King George sits high over Scarborough, cannons firmly set across the Atlantic. Built during the 1770s, it traces the turbulent times when France and Britain wrestled for control over the island. It now houses the Tobago Museum, which holds prized colonial artefacts and rare Amerindian remains. Fort James is another worth a look, looming over Tobago’s old capital Plymouth; the views from the top are spectacular. Whilst your there, don’t miss Plymouth’s mystery grave – the cryptic inscription has puzzled people for generations.
      - Talking of tombstones, be sure to ask locals about the grave and legend of Gang Gang Sara. The slave witch’s tragedy echoes a chilling and deeply sad zeitgeist of slavery. From folkloric tales to the Tobagonian immortalised – don’t miss the Kimme Museum. The artist Luis Kimme spent years crafting idiosyncratic sculptures of the people around her, now housed in her former home turned museum. A fascinating cultural landmark that heroes the people of the island.
