Mountain valley views await, with the chirping of forest life the soundtrack to your hike.

    description: Tobago is wonderfully untamed. Vast swathes of the island are protected, ensuring the unique habitats of the island’s wildlife are kept undisturbed. A rare treat, spy giant leatherback turtles on the island’s beaches as they come ashore to nest over summer. At Corbin Local Wildlife Park, you can meet the island’s endangered and treasured inhabitants. Wild caimans hang out next to natural pools, and manicou, boa constrictors and iguanas can be seen up-close in a series of enclosures. This nonprofit sanctuary is the best place to learn more about Tobago’s diverse wildlife.

    title: Little Tobago
    description: Off the eastern coast lies a tiny island affectionately named Little Tobago. It is also known as Bird of Paradise Island, a remote and untamed rock that is perfect for spotting all manner of colourful birdlife. Head for Speyside harbour and hitch a ride on one of the glass-bottomed boat tours. As you cross, be sure to look down; the glass bottom reveals the reefs below the water. Most tours will also stop and give you the opportunity to snorkel. As you land on the island, keep a keen eye; you’ll spot frigate birds, brown boobies, terns and the elegant red-billed tropicbird. Follow the trails for captivating views, as you share the island with one of the Caribbean’s largest seabird colonies.
